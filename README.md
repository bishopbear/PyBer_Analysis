# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:

To create a summary dataframe of ride-sharing data by city type over a given time period. We will also inlcude a visual to better understand the story of the data.

Results:

We found that population density correlates to overall revenue. There are more people in urban centers and therefore more overall revenue to be recognized. Using the different available data we can see that even though the dollars per ride are much higher in rural areas, there are just not as many rides to capture. This analysis has shown that ultimately the major revenue opportunity exists in the urban centers. The suburban areas should not be forgotten either. Suburban areas show to have about 40-50% of the revenue capability as the urban areas. As for the rural areas, they do have a significantly higher dollar per ride figure but there are just not enough rides to make an impact.

The biggest factor affecting the urban data is that there are significantly more drivers. The large amount of drivers in urban areas pulls down fare amount per ride. There are 30 times more drivers in urban areas than there are in rural areas. So the main question is how much is PyBer getting per ride in urban areas?

Recommendations to CEO:

After reviewing the revenue numbers thus far we recommend drilling further into the revenue breakdown per ride in per city type. In this analysis we recommend focusing on urban rides. The reason is the overall dollar amount is just that much greater than the rural or the suburban. The second recommendation is to analyze the possibility of an increase in price for the urban area. Can the urban areas that PyBer currently does business in support an increase in price? There are a few questions that can be asked to help us understand if this is a viable option to research. What sets PyBer apart? Is there untapped value here. Who are our riders and why do they choose PyBer? In this analysis we think it is also important to ask the question how many divers should be available per rides being completed? The results of this questions could show that having less drivers available could help support higher pricing. 

Another piece of analysis should be the competition. Who is PyBer competing with? A full SWOT analysis of both PyBer and its competitors will help management with its next steps.
The last thought on PyBer is what revenue does the overall market provide and what is PyBer's share? How much room for growth is there?

While there are a lot of questions being posed here for further analysis we believe that the information we have gathered and processed does give PyBer a solid footing to begin understanding where to focus their upcoming efforts.
